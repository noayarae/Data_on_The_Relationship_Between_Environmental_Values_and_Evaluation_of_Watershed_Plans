The files and scripts in this folder are organized according to the table and figure numbers presented in the manuscript "Relationship Between Environmental Values and the Evaluation of Watershed Conservation Plans that Benefit the Community Versus the Individual".

Most of the scripts were developed in the R programming language, with some components prepared directly in Excel. All analyses were based on two primary raw data files, included in this repository: EPVQ_score_data.csv and Rating_of_participants_to_the_suggested_plans.csv.

For proper reproduction or execution of the analyses, please note the following:

Excel files do not require execution. Users can simply open them with any compatible spreadsheet software.

R scripts are provided in two formats: .R and .ipynb. Users may choose either format for reproduction.

.R files should be executed using R.

.ipynb files should be run in Google Colab with the R kernel enabled.

Some tables and figures generated by R scripts were subsequently formatted using other software to enhance their presentation in the manuscript.
