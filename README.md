## **Data on The Relationship Between Environmental Values and the Evaluation of Watershed Conservation Plans that Benefit the Community Versus the Individual**

This repository contains the data used in the article "The Relationship Between Environmental Values and the Evaluation of Watershed Conservation Plans that Benefit the Community Versus the Individual".

These data include two files containing EPVQ scores of participants (EPVQ_score_data.csv) and participants' rating of suggested conservation practice plans (Rating_of_participants_to_the_suggested_plans.csv).


This repository contains the full dataset and R scripts used in the article "The Relationship Between Environmental Values and the Evaluation of Watershed Conservation Plans That Benefit the Community Versus the Individual."

The materials are organized as follows:

- raw_data/: Contains the original input data used in the study.

      EPVQ_score_data.csv: Environmental Portrait Value Questionnaire (E-PVQ) scores for all participants.

      Rating_of_participants_to_the_suggested_plans.csv: Participant ratings of the 20 suggested conservation practice plans.

- code_and_pre_processed_data/: Contains all R scripts and pre-processed datasets required to replicate the analyses.

      Scripts are organized by the article's four main objectives. Sub-objectives (e.g., Objectives 2 and 3) have corresponding, clearly labeled scripts.

      Pre-processed datasets are stored in this folder and are ready to be read directly by the scripts.

      Each script is annotated to facilitate reproducibility and corresponds to a specific analysis or figure in the manuscript. Users can run the scripts sequentially to reproduce the results presented in the article.
